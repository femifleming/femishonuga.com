The <a href="wiki/clouds.html">cloud</a> speakers are finally done so I also wanted to make this an exhibition opening to show them during the party. We also had an event at "The Washing Machine" in the new machine courtyard that we want to do maybe twice a month to raise money for rent: Rinse Cycle at the Washing Machine.

<p>In boston yesterday I played a show outside, deep in a park near a strip mall organized by Barbie and Tobias, with their awesome TOA 38-sd speakers and Eminance subs. Sounded great, I'm really in love with these speakers and how colorful they are, in paint and sound. I started painting some of my speakers fun colors. We used my peavy speakers as the booth monitors which sounded pretty good! The party went from 8pm to 5am.</p>

<h3>Building HiFi Speakers</h3>
<p>Right now I'm <a href="wiki/speakers.html">building</a> these hifi open baffle hybrid speakers from sub drivers that Hoolihan dropped off at the studio, mid range Page drivers that were used at PA speakers in the ceilings at my studio probably in the offices that occupied the space in the 90s and early 2000s, and tweeters Eli harvested from some studio monitors. This is my first HiFi Build and I'm doing it right, trying to build a nice crossover and everything, I was quad amping it for a while, using my modular to make crossover filters before the amp. The page drivers are open baffle and the BASS (bad ass serious sub) drivers are in a closed box, with no port. Matt Azevedo is helping me do the calculations, I need a windows computer to run Hornresp and RoomEQWizard. And i need to order some more parts for the crossover, but I've harvested some power caps and inductors from old speaker cabinets in the basement of the Firehouse. I'm learning a lot about crossover design and speaker impedance. The page drivers had transformers on the back of them that made me think that they would be a super high impedance but they ended up just being 8ohms. I have been looking at a lot of Japan HiFi Audio listening rooms with crazy compression drivers for the whole system, connected to these insane sculptural horns that spiral the house into the attic to make the length of the horn for bass response and I want to build something like that for my architecture thesis.</p>

<h3>
Trip to Georgia for AMIS 2025
        </h3>
        <p>On June 5th, 2025, Me and Enzo left for Georgia in his 1973 MG B That he had just finished restoring, building the engine basically from scratch. The engine had about 550 miles on it before we embarked on our journey, and 3573 when we returned to providence on the 10th. The car did very well on the trip, there was a tiny leak from the back seal of the break fluid tubing, and at one point the fan belt became a little loose (which we fixed on the spot). We watched the weather for the radar and listed to the local weather radio, outran a few thunderstorms and baked in the heat for the first couple days. We swam in a lake, river ot beach for at least the first 3 days to cool off. We made stops in Torrington, Stony Point Beach, Gettysburg, Front Royal (Along the beautiful Skyline Drive, with the highest elevation being 3600 ft), Eastover, Dillon, and Georgetown before finally arriving in Savannah. That night we walked along the dock near the water in the fancier part of savannah, lots of candy shops and restaurants along the active port. Some of the boat port buildings had been converted into malls. We watched the lightning in the storm we escaped for a while, past the cranes moving shipping containers, while Enzo explained to me the precision and skill needed to operate these big huge cranes carrying tons of weight. We also talked about tug boats and radioactive material. We went looking for a diveyer bar and ended up at Dew Drop Inn in Forest Ridge. The bartender lady talked about her experience at Woodstock 99 and confirmed everything I heard about it was true. We ate a couple weiners that had been sitting out in one of those dog heating machines at the bar, two weiners per bun, and booked it to a motel in Dublin, where a drunk man in a Trump shirt surrounded by 4 or 5 dogs told Enzo the MG was "running a lil rich", which ended up being true, before directing us to the motel we were actually looking for. On the journey back we also stopped in Athens, Tallulah Falls and slept at our friend Tristain's cottage in Highlands (with a max elevation of around 4000ft). The hight difference took some getting used to. Highlands had a really creepy vibe to it, like the whole town had been haunted and rebuilt after some tragic disaster. All the buildings in the main city looked brand new, as if they were built in the last 5 years or so. We finally stopped in Danbury, where there was an abandoned greenhouse behind the gas station, before arriving in providence on the 10th at around 11pm.</p>
<div style="border-left: 2px white;">
<p>firsts:</p>
<li><i>QT gas station is gas. Nitro cold brew on tap for $2? insane. And they had like 10 other coffees on tap. They had wine, beer, like 10 slushy flavors, everything you could ever need.</i></li>
<li><i>Waffle house is preety good honestly, surprised at how good the grits were. My mom and grandma make pretty good grits and these lived up for sure.</i></li>
<li><i>Bought my first pack of lucky strikes, because how could i resist them being $6, somewhere in the south at some gas station.</i></li>
<li><i>First time seeing so many deer, a fox, and hearing frogs, and being at an elevation that high.</i></li>

<p>Dumpster Hot Tub Party</p>

<p><img src="wiki/links/dht2.webp"></p>
<p>shifting the program of the dumpster, a part of the infrastructure of waste and sewage , into a ritual experience, a community gathering and interaction with water, a public demonstration of the physics of water flow
the water not being that hot presented it sort of as an endurance test , the more people that decided to make the plunge at once the mere- warmer the water got reminding me of collective effort and indigenous ritual practices a ritual that gives thanks to the land, through water flow and the body, abstracting the architecture of the 30ft dumpster the flow of water, int terms of where it ends up.</p>

<p>Today was my first day back at RISD. I just came back from a gap year. I really needed it, i got a lot done. Getting back has been super annoying. With financial aid. I cant afford art school. They put a hold on my registration because I needed to pay an outstanding balance, for my dining, that was their fault, when they switched over to workday from their other payment or mgmt system they forgot to charge me for dining, or something.. idek anymore. There's something unique about the way arch is discussed from a design perspective. From analysis, documantarianiacariumness and representation you can do material studies used in architecture to express certain moments in design, and their applications and functionalities. There is something mysterious and magical about the depths of the drain tunnels. The long echoing acoustics, or short rattles of reverb. These can be captured with convolution, setting off an impulse response in the space, popping a balloon, clapping. this can be used spatially, electronically to playback these sounds in those spaces. Theres an interesting drain of drain drains ion the drains of the drains locally located in water drains.</p>

<p>Today me and Daniel made a 4to1 x2 passive mono 1/4in mixer for the dax tree. It's the new rendition of the femi style sandwich, with thick mulberry sides, and open front and back/or top and bottom, and pater style scrap wood cutting board sandwich face. Instead of the 4 screw corner sandwich. I think I'll do future builds like this, its nice. I want to make a stereo version of this for my gear. I tried to modify a switched passive mixer by adding resistors between all the connections so it wouldn't feed back but I'm not sure I did it right, and I think the unit was already old and not completely working (I think that just entails that there are some rusty contacts/it needs to be cleaned, which is doable, i may revisit it soon, and test along the way, it would be great if it was.)</p>

<p>Today I made a lot of progress on my personal server! Grief found this old tower computer for me in the RISD E-Waste pile alongside a bunch of old mac laptops and other desktop towers. We gutted it and put in a new graphics card and 5 4tb hard drives, and a ssd to boot from. The server is running linux debian, with no desktop. It's set up in a Raid array. Today we got it hooked up to a network so that i could start uploading files to the server via rsync on the same ip. We had some trouble finding a good 3d print file for the hard drive holder but we just ended up zip-tieing it and it was fine. I used Grief's <a href="https://redeel.org/spellbook">spellbook</a> to set up most of the raid array and figure out file transferring as we updated it. The 4tb external ssd that had my entire life of files on it was wrapped in gaffer tape along eith 3 other external hard drives, so I had them all in one place. We ripped these apart, in an attempt to extract the ssd from the enclosure for faster transfer times, but the enclosure was too tightly closed, and it seemed as though it would not be one of the drives that would allow us to separate the ssd. </p>

		    <p>Here are a few of the Arbrassons I've made with help from Daniel! I've been working with Daniel as an assistant mostly, learning how to make daxophones and design pcbs and enclosures for solar sounders. Woodworking has been very fun. I really like using the planar, and the japanese style hand planes. I'm ready to step up my synth box game now for sure. Also no longer afraid of the table saw. So far my philosophy remains anti-miter and anti-dovetail. AND anti-resin, unless its for a cuprobrassum (led window).</p>

The Waterworks Museum interprets the unique stories of one of the country's first metropolitan water systems through exhibitions and educational programs on engineering, architecture, social history, public health, and Safe Water Access. This space presents incredible acoustics for acoustic and electronic performances. I am always thinking about transforming spaces with sound and this was a unique opportuniy where the space truely transformed my sound and the way I perform. Space and acoustics are extremely important to the work I do as sadnoise and this is a wonderful example of reverb, reflections and natural acoustics in conversation with experimental electronics.

<h3><em><a href="dogevox.html">Dogevox V2</a></em></h3>
<p>This is the second iteration of Dogevox. Dogevox is a collectionn of different ciat lonbarde pcbs: The Lil Sidrassi, Dogvoice and Rolz (4 and 6). I had a lot of fun with this build. The box is a cohiba cigar box, with the sides sawn off and walnut panels screwed in. The top is a custom collage with sharpie drawn to find the perfect 5ths for the layout of the jacks. Lil Sidrassi and rolz is a perfect pair, and offers so much range, especially with the 12 position switches for the hairy caps on lil sid. In the future I think I'de choose some more random values for the rolz, and make led windows out of resin instead of put them right through the top.</p>

    <h3><em>SRST Sessioins 001: Cryptwarblr</em></h3>
<p>Welcome to the first installation of SRST Sessions. SRST Sessions is a video series highlighting local artists in Providence, RI in an attempt to bridge the gap between music academia at RISD and Brown and the local music scene in providence and the surrounding areas. The SRST or the Studio for Research in Sound and Technology is a 25.4 channel speaker array at RISD used primarily for teaching spatial audio and ambisonics, but has become a space for practice, performance and exploration over the years.</p>
<p>Artist Bio: Cryptwarblr (Alex Bernhardt) is a circuit-bending project investigating bent ROM data in a Casio MT-240 synthesizer. Using homemade patch-bay-and-switchboard array controllers, data carrying lines between the ROM &amp; CPU can be cross-connected in various combinations for unusual sonic effects. These combinations can affect timbre, pitch, adsr, tremolo, gliss, texture, pattern, chord, and tuning, in a bizarre but repeatable way, as long as electric parameters are consistent. Alex’s research in electronics is in how to achieve precise control over small levels of resistance in order to clearly define logic levels across the types of cross-connection combinations. To facilitate music-making, Alex has developed their own hybrid music-electrical notation system and has cataloged hundreds of cross-connections. Their music weaves between combinations of connections in an attempt to explore a sonic landscape painted by the instrument’s offerings.</p>
<p>These events are organized and curated by Femi Shonuga-Fleming with special thanks to Shawn Greenlee, Mark Cetilia and all of the wonderful artists in this series including Cryptwarbler for kicking off the series!</p>

<i>I think granular synthesis is a good form of synthesis to relate sound and manipulate sound with the idea of the organic in mind. In simple words, granular synthesis is a form of audio synthesis that operates on the microsound time scale, meaning less than a second. You start with a source audio and various synthesis techniques can be used to chop this audio up into small samples or grains that make up the audio. These individual grains can then be repeated over and over as you slowly scan through the set of grains to stretch the audio out and manipulate the audio as if it were putty or dough that you're stretching across a surface. You can change the size of the grains, and overlap the grains to create unique soundscapes and completely rework the original audio.<br>
	I'm drawn to this form of experimenting with audio in this project in particular because as a concept, it's related to nature, generation and generativeness, an initial state of being, and evolution over time.<br>
	Granular synthesis reminds me of grains of sand. The wind blows grains of sand in the wind to create a new portrait in the ground. recorded audio is a trim and cut/sample of that moment in time.<br>
	representing sound visually, sand and dust<br>
of relation to minimalism and minimalistic moves within composition
Granular synthesis reminds me of evolution. You start with a set of genes, that is your audio, your initial state, first generation, and as you stretch that state, that initial audio over time, the longer the audio is stretched, the audio adapts to itself and has to inevitably evolve into a new form of being.
Granular synthesis reminds me of raindrops in a storm. Microsound in repetition as time stretches is essentially a ritual practice as the longer the audio is stretched the more the repetition of elements of the audio and the longer the ritual practice.<br>

<p><a href="https://github.com/risdsound/foafx?ref=codetea.com">Foafx</a> - A command line tool for applying spatially positioned audio effects to first order ambisonic sound files</p>
<p>foafx is a command line tool for applying spatially positioned audio effects to first order ambisonic sound files. It is written with Elementary, a JavaScript framework for writing audio applications, and uses its offline-renderer package.</p>
<p>As its input, foafx expects a B-format, 4-channel first order ambisonic encoded file with ACN channel ordering. It supports file normalization either in SN3D or N3D formats.</p>
<p>In order to apply a chosen effect, foafx decodes the B-format file using a simple Sampling Ambisonic Decoder (SAD) into an octahedral arrangement with six vertices that represent virtual microphone positions. Then, the effect is applied with the specified parameters including its spatial position (azimuth and elevation). After effect processing, the six signals are encoded back to B-format, panned to the matching octahedral positions of the decoder, and rendered to an output file. The result is an ambisonic wet/dry effect mix with wet focussed in a specific area of the sound field.</p>
