	<p>I have another release out on my bandcamp today, this one is part of my thesis, exploring my diy instruments as ritual objects unique in their character. Most of the release explores the xiaohongshu gewei, a marriage of an old ciat lonbarde instrument and Chinese internet culture. For a while I was seeing if I could train my Instagram algorithm to feed me only content screen-grabbed from xiaohongshu , basically chinas version of Instagram, with some success, for fun. Thinking about location and geography, especially with material, sonic content and atmosphere, and how that changes depending on where you are. Continuing to explore creating impossible or experimental atmospheres and spaces with sound. I really love Peter Blassers circuits, they have such character and organic nature to them. They are a wonderful outlet to explore this connection between the internet, electronics and nature, and have been very inspiring to my design philosophy in music and architecture. I hope to explore these ideas more through instrumentation and sonic landscapes in future releases, as well as more collaborations with maybe some more musical musicians.

The internet is such a funny place, I’m not so much influenced by meme culture as much as I’m influenced by this idea of interconnectivity and call and response as evolution of content, catalogs of life or hyper specific portfolios, in narcissistim and empathy. Instagram is so not a real place and that’s what’s so awesome about it.

“The idea of the internet being infinite played with my perception of time and data. Sometime around 2018 I became very obsessed with archiving and documenting things well, and putting out as much content on the internet as a cloud, as a personal archive and also to build my relationship with this infinite void that was the internet. Most of this content was through Instagram and Youtube.”

The yappepedium was an ancient hall crystallized with the fossils of skulls of those whose words echoes quiet landscapes with nonsensical strings of words.</p>

	<p>This release is an collection and data log of atmosphere and gas clouds. This album is part of the series of albums towards my thesis. This release focuses on themes of space and expedition, atmosphere, satellite, probes, beacons, drones and scientific research. 

Of relation to my thesis: a vessel travels, what is the sound of travel, and how it relates to the body. What is the sound of travel in dreams, of disappearance. The acoustics of a missing object. How can we amplify sound in space for the purpose of found objects, a directional scan.

	<p>Live Pictures in Music is an album exploring the ritual practice of live performance. theres something about performing in the dark
i want people to focus on the sound
its not the image
	if it is
		some sonic architecture
			transporting themselves into a new space
				into my space
A darkness
	a sad noise
		“great set brother”
in genuine
with little thought for words

In my music
A Jazz
Or some sampled white girl asmr video
An abstraction
For contrast
In genuine
A homage
To early internet
	On blue screens

What is it about
A vlog of a white gorl learning how to wine for the first time
A Starbucks in the favela

An interest in culture
In genuine
With little thought for words

	Things my handy husband made for me to make my morning routine easier! 
	My husband 3d printed this hook for my shower to hang my clothes so I can
	easily pick the perfect outfit in the morning

Whilst empty content
A rap of words

The pumpkin spice latte is back in stock
I think it’s hilarious
Along with the stereotypes
My black father is married to a white woman
Raised by my African mother
A strange interaction
With kids on walk street
And artsy students at school
With their succulents and skirts over jeans
Which I’ll never understand that style
They feel is genuine
With their hook in the shower to early pick out the perfect outfit in the morning
With little thought for words

In a strange environment
With the lights off
A performance
An obsession with the internet
Without hooks

I’ve leaned everything backwards
My mother didnt know about slavery until coming to the us in her 20s
And didn’t properly understand it until her 40s

My dad knew in genuine
With little thought for words
To talk about it before they separated

I’ve learned everything backwards
The “great set brother”

But at the same time
When I tell people my color I make music
They still assume I make beats
“The drum is central to the music”
But if corse
The internet
I would find out about Romanian minimal techno
Before finding the roots of house and techno in Chicago and Detroit
Due to my attraction in the esoteric and obscure natures of sound
I’m interested in the evolutions of sounds
And I can most often spot out when something’s evolved from a source
Because it’ll be weird
And I like that
In genuine
With sometimes little thought
For how did we get here

But Im not bothered by this backwards learning
Or by the evolution
It’s all beautiful

	In noise
I’m sure has its roots in black culture
I’m often the dark room in the performance
	In dj culture
When did it switch from the rich underground
	“Dancing to be free”
        In genuine
        With little regard for words
        An escape from the 9-5
        Friday night to Monday morning
        At the palladium
		To
$150 tickets
For 4 hours
A boiler room
A boiler room
That’s supposed to be that room hidden in the corner, the secret party
That no one knows about
For the culture
In genuine

Not the image
Of the dj in the center
They are not the priest

But why do I care
In all this sampled content
In conversation
In relationships
In genuine
I still give thanks to the ground beneath my feet
In dead languages
“The drum is central to the music”
My feet are buried deep within the sounds that surround me
In colliding cultures
I try to find rythm
In noise
As Jazz
With soul
With sound as words
To tell my story
In non Linear nature
As time passes

With no regard to those who make comments in genuine with little regard for words I cannot entertain

A blackness
Can be defined by performing in the dark
Not everything shall be a rap
Of words
At the Boiler Room
In a well of water

The drum is the oldest form of communication
On dark sweaty floors
My shoes chained to the bass
A resonating frequency
A room full of reflections
And bodies absorbing</p>
<p><a href="https://sadnoise.bandcamp.com/album/ritual">RITUAL</a> is the first release in a series of Albums I'll be releasing every month for a year as part of my thesis. This series focuses on ideas of sound as ritual practice along with themes of <a href="arch.html">architecture</a>, <a href="dreams.html">dreams</a>, land acknowledgment, academia, indigenous practices, sexuality, love and relationships and the <a href="4chan.org">internet</a>. The purpose of this series is to really dive into the idea of recorded improvisation as a ritual practice and generative/<a href="code.html">algorithmic</a> systems as a connection to nature and the organic/organism. Sadnoise has always been as much about the conversation between the internet and nature or the &quot;absence&quot; of the internet as it has been about the interaction between produced or manipulated sound and physical space.</p>

<p><a href="Systems.pdf">SYSTEMS</a> is an album archiving written and sonic explorations of various analog and digital systems that I use during the process of designing sound, as an attempt to demystify some synth esoteria.</p>
<p>Listening Instructions (suggested):
Listen to this album in full or in smaller periods of time, in direct sunlight, or a low lit environment,
preferably with headphones, or speakers spread far apart. Sit or lay down in a comfortable place
and position. Have your favorite snacks or beverages nearby for occasional consumption. Read
the track stories as the corresponding tracks play.</p>

Meditation:<br>
Internet meditation interlude entrance opening introduction cleansing clear cmd
delete.<br>
Bath:<br>
A analog bubblebath with warm water and starburst candy bath bomb, with non
mainstream super esoteric ambient music playing, and fruit loops scented candles,
the water reaches your body temperature and you close your eyes and start to float
away, on cotton candy clouds, bubbles begin to sound larger than life. The internet
seems far, far away. The concept of dirt is erased from your memory. Too many
things are erased from your memory, but you’re okay with it, because the only
direction is forwards.<br>
digitamblamAh:<br>
Finally some quiet, a taxi. Steady travel. At night. With a gin and tonic, chauffeured.
Take me to a black tie event. With normal people. Where I can’t make out faces. A
place where I can ignore important tasks. And time doesn't move. Dragged by the
hand into an endless hallway. Escaping with someone, anyone. If I could fill all my
bags with the items on these walls I would. And fill a room with infinite things. A
hoarder's dream. But just to look at. I have a separate room for the things I used.
Stumbling. She's walking maybe a bit too fast.<br>
i get too cold drawn some that:<br>
A song in silence: Its so I get it’s so I get its for to go on or not its so I get it's there
you were cold in it call the word hold to he had night after as. A thought about the
idea of. What do I you actually want? Inherently peaceful. In its simplicity.<br>
jazz beat in soil (movement 1 and 2):<br>
The jazz bar on ⟊⏃⋉⋉ ⏚⏃⍀ and opcod 19287 off of conduit Jester. A quintet for
romance, in two movements. With a Paloma. Movement two suggests a red, 2021
preferably. And filet mignon. I can afford I t, for both of us.<br>
pearls:<br>
Back to work, wired. I'm dating the boss's daughter, I gotta be there on time. Little
does he know she's cheating on me. What a scandal. With Cathy in HR. I knew she
was a lesbian. You can’t sneak out an air lock, and she was bad at excuses. Oh your
book club, all the way in sector G. I haven't said anything about it yet. This job pays
well. And Cathy is 7 feet tall. I’m only 2 feet 4 inches and 45 centimeters. I can't
compete. She'll punt me. As long as I get my numbers in this quarter. I’ll quit. I’ll
have a cig now. I never thought to go out on the balcony. No one ever does.
Probably because we work on the 596th floor. The air is dry up here. I think I’ll go
out for a cig now. The whole office won't get sucked out through this door once I
open it right haha. [the entire office did indeed implode in on itself through the glass
pane door the second it was pulled inward.] Well… definitely getting fired now.<br>
Pleasantly drunk, with wings:<br>
A return to some home. A dinner at someone else's. With a beer, driven in a car
with many miles. Those swirly things you see when you get up too fast, haven't
eaten all day, or stare at a perfect blue sky, have a sound. An awkward couple, yet
charming. Retired.<br>
swih aybz intersexon:<br>
You find yourself millenia deep in incomprehensible alien data simplex
intersections, figures of light speed past and begin to intimidate you. A
confrontation. With only words, a new story. With noise and absence of time. A
feeling of longing. A nostalgia of the unknown. An afrofuturist retrofuture. Dark in
headlights. Frozen, melting and falling infinitely. Limbo, traveling.
All of your technology will function properly this mercury retrograde:
Place 10 fruity pebbles on your phone and laptop every morning and night for good
luck with technology this mercury retrograde. Something else that might help is
suspending a bag of your technology above a large body of water for 5 seconds, or
bringing your technology at least 1000 ft above sea level.<br>
