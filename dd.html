<h2>2025-01-30</h2>
<p>I had a dream that fort thunder is just a large orange room. With alien echos across. No one was actual real, just blabber into the orange abyss. Mericlaire had a thick southern accent. I haven't met her before. Her long, wavy brown hair, in the low blue light of the mazy messy apartment. clubclub was a speakeasy, a word combo, I had always forgotten, opened the square concrete slab door. A pully system, from a corner in the messy blue apartment. The open windows blew cold air on my feet, hanging over the edge of my bed. A character stayed in the apartment, he was always there on our return. Back and forth after many beers, I had always forgotten what I came back to do. Another dream, a solo pregame to a big party. Friendly faces and people that look like ive known them since high school. There was a comfort her face gave. What a weird name.

<p>I had a dream I was preparing for a show, in a big white room with a giant skylight. The house was a maze, the even bigger living room, dark, with only wall windows, couches surrounded nothing. In my dreams I always have a serge. The apartment bedroom, moving along the coastline of the city, with the aboveground trains. On the trains I always loose something, or miss my stop. The cars are always flooded with sunlight. Carrying an unusual bag.</p>

<p>No friends at the party, everyone got drunk but me, Sizwe and the blue bottle of olive oil vodka. In the smallest bar in town. Some white girl asking me some stupid question made me laugh while I was crying. smoking my enormous cigarette. My lighter exploded when I lit it, had to put out my first fire, with big blankets, a new burned hole in my oldest duvet. Running down the stairs, so the house won’t smell.</p>

<p>I had a dream where there was a gang that they sent you out to this virtual forest with a group of people and you all had to sleep one night in a hut in the forest and one night in this empty school and one night in an empty hotel with other fictional characters, I was one of the people who went with my nerd friends and they were trying to hook up with the anime characters in the hotel and I was trying to hook up with the furries which didn’t end up happening to I went on a quest with the white girl to go steal from the house across from the hotel, which apparently the businessman who lived there was expecting us and had Gus pointed to us in his long messy hallway garage , but then we noticed samurai’s trying to break into his house and kill him cus one of them has been seeing his wife, so he let us try and kill the samurai’s but apparently we weren’t supposed to kill anyone in the simulation so we lost the game when I shot the samurai’s </p>

<p>Some acoustic environment, a cocktail bar with a deep blue light. Horn loaded speakers were built into the stereo walls, the bass horn spanned the whole wall, with the tweeters above and below. The blue light was so deep I almost counlnt see anything. A similar blue room tonight, naked at a sleepover. A girl I was questioning perusing. Who was she? There’s always someone. A bathroom with a bed in it. A teal hue, cotton floors, a hoarders bathroom. I had a flight to Greece I was supposed to catch earlier, what time was it? The above ground train had an impossible view, flying over crystal clear waters in a valley between dark umber mountains and low fog. The day was nearing its end, as its transparent skies grew dim. My  mother count carry my luggage any longer, she hadn’t told me she left it at the last station. There was no way I wasn’t going to miss this flight. In shallow water I waded towards my bags. Alexis would know everything. I pent the last couple days embarrassing myself in every situation I could. To the girl with the pink notebook int he shape of a splash, and her temp fishnets. Generic, I’m not sure what it is about, The aesthetics of normality, or rather normalness. I have a show in Greece. </p>

<h2>2021-06-21</h2>
<p>All of these rooms look so familiar… I could've sworn I've been here before but in this world, for some reason I have no concept of time, or any memories for that matter. Truely where was I In life, in time, space? This would be a new journey, I'm still young. My skin is smooth, I'm slim, my suit fits nicely. I can remember a few spaces, all unfamiliar, but they are very deeply ingrained in my memory. The farthest away space, a warehouse, with broken machinery, loose bolts, creaking. A warm environment. The sunlight casting golden geometries onto the dusty broken tiles through the shattered plexiglass windows and buckling conduit. A memory in sepia. A space so large the architecture seemed infinite… in the middle of nowhere. Deserted, in the desert. But what brought me to this structure of abandonment? How do you sift through the dust to find the answers to what this could all mean? In this moment, let this space be home, for it is where I have been placed. And let each room be a memory. The air is dull, there is longing and depression here no doubt. I sit at a walnut desk with curved legs. It's wood malnourished and dry. Sunwashed floral wallpaper frames the ominous windows in this room. At night the room is tungsten, to mimic the burnt out glow from the sun during the day. I don't trust the sun, I like it at night…</p>
