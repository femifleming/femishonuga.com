<p>Enid is my super pretty girlfriend. Even though we have not been dating long, it feels like forever and i love her very much. Shes extremely intellegent, an amazing artist and critical thinker. Shes kind, loving and respectful, and I'm so lucky to be her boyfriend. And shes pretty funny. I havnt felt this way about anyone before. I hope we know eachother for a lifetime.</p>
