<article class="blugh"><p>This is the final iteration of my first 3 way open baffle speaker design.</p>
<p>The tweeter is a 6ohm paper cone closed back driver harvested from an old pioneer speaker.</p>
<p>The mid range driver is a page industries 8ohm 8inch speaker driver harvested from ceiling world at my studio at nicleson file co, used for public address. Its high sensitivity and I had to use many resistors to get it around the same loudness as the other drivers.</p>
<p>The bottom drivers are 8ohm 15in drivers harvested from amps in the basement of the firehouse in worchester.</p>
<p>The cutoff at the high end is around 3k and the low end about 300hz</p>
<p>Changing the 8in 4ohm diver to a 15in 8ohm driver did wonders for the bass. Now that the bass is dipole its louder and more efficient.</p>
<p>Once I pair these with my 4ohm dual 15 peavy black widow ripole subwoofers i plan to design, I can get the bass fast and deep down to ideally 30hz.</p>
