<figcaption class="right">The traffic cone calls "scream through me!" The cone is loaded with a high frequency compression driver, and designed as a 'reentrant (reflex) horn loudspeaker, or bullhorn, is a type of folded horn speaker used widely in public address systems. To reduce the size of the horn, the sound follows a zigzag path through exponentially expanding concentric ducts in the central projection, emerging from the outer horn.' The bass is the "buried electric" The speaker is the shrine, this is a sonic artifact in the sound anthology.</figcaption>
