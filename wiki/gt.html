Trip to Georgia for AMIS 2025
        </h3>
        <p>On June 5th, 2025, Me and Enzo left for Georgia in his 1973 MG B That he had just finished restoring, building the engine basically from scratch. The engine had about 550 miles on it before we embarked on our journey, and 3573 when we returned to providence on the 10th. The car did very well on the trip, there was a tiny leak from the back seal of the break fluid tubing, and at one point the fan belt became a little loose (which we fixed on the spot). We watched the weather for the radar and listed to the local weather radio, outran a few thunderstorms and baked in the heat for the first couple days. We swam in a lake, river ot beach for at least the first 3 days to cool off. We made stops in Torrington, Stony Point Beach, Gettysburg, Front Royal (Along the beautiful Skyline Drive, with the highest elevation being 3600 ft), Eastover, Dillon, and Georgetown before finally arriving in Savannah. That night we walked along the dock near the water in the fancier part of savannah, lots of candy shops and restaurants along the active port. Some of the boat port buildings had been converted into malls. We watched the lightning in the storm we escaped for a while, past the cranes moving shipping containers, while Enzo explained to me the precision and skill needed to operate these big huge cranes carrying tons of weight. We also talked about tug boats and radioactive material. We went looking for a diveyer bar and ended up at Dew Drop Inn in Forest Ridge. The bartender lady talked about her experience at Woodstock 99 and confirmed everything I heard about it was true. We ate a couple weiners that had been sitting out in one of those dog heating machines at the bar, two weiners per bun, and booked it to a motel in Dublin, where a drunk man in a Trump shirt surrounded by 4 or 5 dogs told Enzo the MG was "running a lil rich", which ended up being true, before directing us to the motel we were actually looking for. On the journey back we also stopped in Athens, Tallulah Falls and slept at our friend Tristain's cottage in Highlands (with a max elevation of around 4000ft). The hight difference took some getting used to. Highlands had a really creepy vibe to it, like the whole town had been haunted and rebuilt after some tragic disaster. All the buildings in the main city looked brand new, as if they were built in the last 5 years or so. We finally stopped in Danbury, where there was an abandoned greenhouse behind the gas station, before arriving in providence on the 10th at around 11pm.</p>

<p>firsts:</p>
<li><i>QT gas station is gas. Nitro cold brew on tap for $2? insane. And they had like 10 other coffees on tap. They had wine, beer, like 10 slushy flavors, everything you could ever need.</i></li>
<li><i>Waffle house is preety good honestly, surprised at how good the grits were. My mom and grandma make pretty good grits and these lived up for sure.</i></li>
<li><i>Bought my first pack of lucky strikes, because how could i resist them being $6, somewhere in the south at some gas station.</i></li>
<li><i>First time seeing so many deer, a fox, and hearing frogs, and being at an elevation that high.</i></li>
