<p><i>Enid Corcoran is a Providence based sculptor and multi-media artist. Her work explores themes of internal and external relationships through materiality and hand made objects. She’s most interested in the dichotomies between archival material and themes of playfulness and is focused on bringing these dichotomies to new light through multidisciplinary representation. Enids formal and sculptural representations are inspired by architectural design and craftsmanship. Enid is a recent sculpture graduate student from RISD and is currently collecting, archiving and organizing as she furthers her fabricating skill set and explores self and conversation to self through her future work. Most notable shows include Crown Shyness at Woods Gerry, RI amongst others. </i></p>
